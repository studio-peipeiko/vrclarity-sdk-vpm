# VRClarity SDK Setup Guide

An SDK for VRChat worlds that measures player behavior and sends data to VRClarity. Simply place a Prefab from the right-click menu to automatically measure and send the following data:

| Metric | Description |
|---|---|
| Stay Duration | 9-stage milestones at 1 / 5 / 15 / 30 / 60 / 120 / 240 / 360 / 480 minutes |
| Movement Distance | 6-stage milestones at 10m / 50m / 150m / 400m / 1000m / 2500m |
| Visit Count | Cumulative visit count per player (1-200, 20 buckets) |
| Platform | 5 types: PCVR / Desktop / Quest / Android Mobile / iOS |
| Player Count | Concurrent player count in instance (0-80 players, every 5 minutes) |

All transmitted data is anonymous. No personal information such as displayName or userId is ever sent.

## Requirements

- Unity 2022.3 or later
- VRChat SDK Worlds 3.7.0 or later
- UdonSharp (bundled with VRChat SDK Worlds 3.7.0 or later)

---

## 1. Obtain an API Key

1. Log in to the [VRClarity Dashboard](https://vrclarity.net) with your Discord account
2. Navigate to the **SDK API Key Management** page from the left menu
3. Click "Create New Key"
4. Enter the target World ID (`wrld_...`) and optionally set a label
5. Check the attestation that you are the creator of the world or an authorized collaborator, then create the key
6. Copy the displayed **Key ID** and **Encryption Key** and save them securely

> **Important:** The Encryption Key is only shown once on this screen. It cannot be retrieved after leaving the page, so make sure to copy it immediately.

---

## 2. Install the Package

### Via VCC (VRChat Creator Companion)

1. Open VCC
2. Go to **Settings** > **Packages** > **Add Repository**
3. Enter the following URL:
   ```
   https://Studio-peipeiko.github.io/vrclarity-sdk-vpm/index.json
   ```
4. Click **Add**
5. Add **VRClarity SDK** from your project's **Manage Project** page

### Manual Installation

1. Copy the `Packages/net.vrclarity.sdk` folder into your Unity project's `Packages/` directory
2. Or use Package Manager's **Add package from disk** and select `package.json`

---

## 3. Set Up in Your World

### 3-1. Place the Prefab

Right-click in the Hierarchy and select **VRClarity > Create Tracker**.

A **VRClarity Notice Panel** is automatically placed alongside the Tracker to inform players about anonymous data collection.

> **About the Notice Panel:** This UI panel notifies players that VRClarity SDK is collecting anonymous statistics. Place it somewhere visible in your world. You can also bulk-change the font via the `VRClarityNoticePanel` component Inspector. To add a Notice Panel independently, right-click in the Hierarchy and select **VRClarity > Create Notice Panel**.

> **Theme & size variants:** Six Notice Panel variants are available to match your world's look. Pick one from the right-click menu.
> - **Create Notice Panel** — Dark theme, standard size (the one auto-placed when creating the Tracker)
> - **Create Notice Panel (Compact)** — Dark theme, compact size (smaller variant that omits the catchphrase and divider)
> - **Create Notice Panel (Minimal)** — Dark theme, minimal badge (logo + "VRClarity Installed" + site URL)
> - **Create Notice Panel (Light)** — Light theme, standard size
> - **Create Notice Panel (Light, Compact)** — Light theme, compact size
> - **Create Notice Panel (Light, Minimal)** — Light theme, minimal badge
>
> The colors match the VRClarity dashboard's light/dark themes. **The Minimal badge does not include the disclosure text.** For transparency about data collection, we recommend pairing the Minimal badge with a standard or compact panel placed somewhere visible.

### 3-2. Configure the Inspector

Enter the following in the VRClarityTracker component Inspector:

| Field | Value | Format |
|---|---|---|
| **Key ID** | Key ID from the dashboard | `sk_` + 24 hex characters |
| **Encryption Key** | Encryption key from the dashboard | 64 hex characters |

> **World ID:** Automatically retrieved from the VRC_SceneDescriptor Blueprint ID at bake time. No manual input required.

Validation results will appear next to each field:
- **OK** — Format is correct
- **Red text** — Format issue detected

### 3-3. Build

Once Key ID and Encryption Key are entered, simply build your world. URLs are automatically generated at build time.

After building, expand "URL Pool Status" in the Inspector to verify the generated URL counts:

```
Stay URLs:      9 / 9
Move URLs:      6 / 6
Visit URLs:    20 / 20
Platform URLs:  5 / 5
PC URLs:       81 / 81
Total:        121 / 121 URLs baked
```

### 3-4. Upload

Upload your world as usual. Data transmission to VRClarity begins as soon as players visit.

> **About data reflection:** It can take **up to about 1 hour** for transmitted data to appear on the dashboard. If no data shows up right after uploading, please wait a while and check again.

---

## 4. View Data on the Dashboard

Once players visit your world, data will appear on the VRClarity dashboard.

For details on how to read the dashboard, see the [VRClarity Documentation](https://vrclarity.net/docs).

## Transmitted Metrics Details

### Stay Duration (9 stages)

Measures elapsed time since the player joined the instance using a milestone approach.

| Milestone | Meaning |
|---|---|
| 1 min | Entered the world |
| 5 min | Stayed briefly |
| 15 min | Spent some time |
| 30 min | Explored in depth |
| 60 min | Long session |
| 120 min | Very long session |
| 240 min | Extremely long session |
| 360 min | Extended stay (6 hours) |
| 480 min | VR sleep / All-day session (8 hours) |

### Movement Distance (6 stages)

Measures cumulative movement distance using a milestone approach.

| Milestone | Meaning |
|---|---|
| 10m | Moved a little |
| 50m | Walked around the world |
| 150m | Actively explored |
| 400m | Covered a wide area |
| 1000m | Very actively moving |
| 2500m | Extremely long distance |

### Visit Count (20 buckets)

Records cumulative visit count per player using PlayerData Persistence. Uses a bucket approach where low counts are tracked individually and higher counts use wider intervals.

Buckets: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 40, 50, 75, 100, 150, 200

Example: A 19th visit is recorded as the "15" bucket (assigned to the nearest bucket at or below the actual count).

### Platform (5 types)

Detects and reports the player's platform when they join an instance.

| ID | Platform | Detection Method |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | PCVR | PC + VR mode |
| 2 | Desktop | PC + non-VR mode |
| 3 | Quest | Android + VR mode |
| 4 | Android Mobile | Android + non-VR mode |
| 5 | iOS | iOS build |

### Player Count (0-80 players)

Periodically reports the concurrent player count in the instance.

**Sending Schedule:**
- On player join (initial)
- Every 5 minutes thereafter

**Player Count Range:**
- Tracks 0-80 players
- Instances with 81+ players are recorded as "80"

**Features:**
- Useful for monitoring real-time concurrent players and peak hours
- Visualizes player count trends during events

### About the Country Distribution

The SDK itself does not transmit any location data. The "Country Distribution" on the dashboard is derived server-side: when a heartbeat is received, the origin country is estimated (via Cloudflare's country detection) and aggregated by country code only. The IP address itself is never stored.

---

## Troubleshooting

### URLs are empty after build

- Verify that Key ID / Encryption Key are correctly entered in the Inspector
- Ensure the VRC_SceneDescriptor Blueprint ID is set
- Check the Console for `[VRClarity]` errors to identify the bake failure cause

### Data not appearing on the dashboard

- Verify the world was uploaded correctly
- Check that at least 1 hour has passed since data transmission started (reflection can take up to about 1 hour)
- Check that the API Key is active (not revoked) on the SDK API Key Management page
- Ensure the API Key is linked to the correct world on the dashboard

### Console shows `Heartbeat send failed`

- Check internet connectivity
- Verify the API Key hasn't been revoked
- Check if the rate limit is being exceeded

---

## Technical Specifications

- **Communication:** HTTPS GET (via VRCStringDownloader)
- **Encryption:** Industry-standard encryption
- **Transmission:** All sends (Stay/Move/Visit/Platform/Player Count) are queue-managed and transmitted sequentially at 5-second intervals
- **Total URLs:** 121 (Stay 9 + Move 6 + Visit 20 + Platform 5 + PC 81)
- **Privacy:** displayName / userId are never sent. Only event type and numeric values are transmitted. Country aggregation is estimated server-side on receipt; IP addresses are never stored
- **Persistence:** PlayerData Persistence for visit counting
- **Synchronization:** Not required. Each player operates independently on their local client
